Muse Systems has substantial experience in working with clients to design new business systems capabilities and to lead teams through the process of turning ideas into actionable system requirements.

## Functional Requirements Development

Ideas come easy, execution is hard.  Coming up with an idea to improve your business, to meet a requirement, or to solve a problem is only the first step towards accomplishing the goal... ...and it may be the easiest step.  The real work begins when you translate those formative ideas into actionable, detailed plans.

Muse Systems helps clients transition ideas into concrete designs and plans which can be given to those tasked with delivering the solution.  Our process is aimed at communicating to the team what goals exist and why they came to be as well as ensuring that details critical to success have been thought through and captured.  The output from this process results in:

  * A clear capture of the goals and rationale behind the project to facilitate the conveyance of that vision to the team members working the project.

  * Documenting the business processes to be supported and identifying expected exceptions and edge cases that must be handled.

  * Detailed identification of system elements and features required to support the envisioned processes.

  * An envisioning of the user interfaces and interactions.

  * Making clear the assumptions driving the design and expected limitations of the envisioned capabilities.

An example of our functional requirements development work:

## User Experience & Iterative Refinement

</div>

The earliest systems planning will envision the processes staff will undertake and the interfaces with which the staff will interact with a system.  As the project progresses and implementations of the plan are tested by the project team, early assumptions driving those planned process and interactions may not continue hold.  Systems project planning and requirements management should be adaptive and responsive to such learning.

The Muse Systems project process recognizes that positive changes will develop and that the early and rapid evaluation and incorporation of refinements is essential to project success.

  * Present results to stakeholding users as early as practical and solicit feedback.

  * Implement a change process which can evaluate and incorporate feedback as quickly as possible.

  * Ensure that the costs of changes reasonable as compared to the benefits.

## Training & Documentation

</div>

If it's not documented it's not done.  Many leave documentation and training as afterthoughts, but any new business system implementation requires that the staff be reasonable trained for success and that reference materials are available when uncommon features to be used or as part of new staff on-boarding.

Muse Systems understands the importance of training and reference materials and makes substantial effort to drive teams to self-sufficiency.
