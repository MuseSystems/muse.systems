## Information Architecture and Databases

Getting questions answered requires that the information exists in such a way that the answer can be extracted.  Yet many databases are constructed only considering how a single application might need to store and maintain the data.  Application interaction is important, but is simply not the only concern.

Muse Systems understands how to architect information in ways that facilitate performant applications while also preserving the semantics and meaning of the information being collected.

Many organizations need to share information between systems and trading partners.  However, the systematic sharing of information is a difficult problem.  Timing, information life-cycle, and information availability differences between systems ultimately have to be accounted for when performing systems integrations or migrating data from one system to another.

Muse Systems has experience designing and building integrations between systems.  We also have performed data migrations in the context of new business system adoption and corporate mergers involving merged data sets.

  * One time data migrations between disparate data stores.

  * Ongoing data integrations between applications including ETL/batch and event driven near real time integrations.

  * Bespoke integrations, Boomi/Pentaho integration development, and service bus based integrations.

Projects include:

  * Pentaho Data Integration based sales order transfer from cloud web-store to ERP.

  * Event driven multi-ERP SQL/MED based integration.

  * Pentaho Data Integration based sales order bulk loading of email/Excel into ERP system.

  * Boomi integration of NetSuite cloud data to client portal database.

  * Various data migrations from legacy business systems to new business systems (manufacturing, distribution, retail).

  * Various data merges of acquired company databases into go-forward systems (retail chain data).
