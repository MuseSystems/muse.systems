Muse Systems is a small business systems implementation and software development consultancy based in San Francisco, CA; USA.  It was founded as a vehicle for the consulting efforts of Steven C. Buttgereit.  We do occasionally work with others under our name and agreements, but largely Steven does the work.

The premise of our business is providing a good quality of service in an honest, straight forward way.  While many consultancies search for ways to extend their billable hours by any means and using any excuse, we always work diligently to ensure that the time we bill brings with it reasonable value to the client.

## What Muse Systems Does

We are dedicated to the systems with which you manage your business.  Our services and products are geared towards your internal staff and management and less so the public.

  * Accounting, budgeting, receivables, & payables systems

  * Inventory management & related logistics systems

  * Procurement & purchase planning systems

  * Sales cycle management systems

  * Customer relationship management systems

  * Reporting & analytics systems

  * Integration between systems and with trading partner systems


## What Muse Systems Doesn't Do

While we're fairly broad in the business systems topics we'll get involved in, there are limits.

  * We aren't a web design shop.

  * We aren't a mobile application development shop.

  * We aren't developing applications targeting consumers.

  * We aren't a hosting provider.

  * We aren't an "outsourced IT" support provider.

  * We don't sell equipment.

Muse Systems is happy to work in tandem on projects with the providers of those services as well as helping our clients find providers specializing in those subjects.
